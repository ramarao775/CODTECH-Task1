## Overview of the Project
### project: Simple calculator
This is a simple command-line calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Objective
1. Provide a menu-driven interface for users to select an arithmetic operation.
2. Accept two numbers as input from the user.
3. Perform the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers.
4. Display the result of the operation.
## Key Attributes
1. Modularity: The code is structured in a modular fashion, with each operation handled in a separate block.
2. User Input Validation: The code checks if the user's operation choice is valid.
3. Error Handling: Although not explicitly handled, the code will raise an exception if the user attempts to divide by zero.
